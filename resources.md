[Guadi Labs](http://www.gaudi.ch/GaudiLabs/): Mostly Open bio hardware

[Pipette Jockey](http://pipettejockey.com/): A little bit of everything, and enzymes!

[Chemically Incompetent](http://chemicallyincompetent.com/): Mostly enzymes

[Bite-size Bio](https://bitesizebio.com/lab-diy/): A little bit of everything

[Free Genes](https://stanford.freegenes.org/)


Lab equipment
-------------
[Open source 3D printed tube rotator/shaker](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468067216300049)

[Open qPCR](https://www.chaibio.com/openqpcr)

Laser-cut and 3D printed [magnetic racks](https://bomb.bio/protocols) from BOMB.bio

There are a ton of very good 3D-printing resources for magnetic racks, but I have to recommend [Sergii Lab Supplies](https://sergilabsupplies.com/) - they've perfected these racks in various form factors and are really reasonably priced


Protocols
---------
[BOMB.bio](https://bomb.bio/): everything magnetic beads, incl. extraction, purification



Tips and tricks
---------------
Never do a phenol:chloroform extraction without [vacuum grease](https://watermark.silverchair.com/21-3-781.pdf) or [Heavy vacuum grease(?)](https://pipettejockey.com/2017/06/21/diy-phase-separating-gel-phase-lock-redux-making-the-dense-version/) again!


Spectrophotometers
------------------

[USB Spectrophotometer](http://renaud.schleck.free.fr/spectrometre.php?lang=en)

[Portable open-source... spectrophotometer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S246806722030016X) which uses [Hamamatsu mini-spectrometer](https://www.hamamatsu.com/resources/pdf/ssd/c12880ma_kacc1226e.pdf)

[Thunder Optics](http://thunderoptics.fr/): Not open source, but they sell some nice, cheap spectrophotometry tools
